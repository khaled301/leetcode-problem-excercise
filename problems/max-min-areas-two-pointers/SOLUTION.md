We have an array height where each element represents the height of a vertical line drawn at that index. These lines are parallel to the y-axis. The idea is to find two such lines that, along with the x-axis, form a container that can hold the most water.

Visual Representation
For the given input height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7], imagine it like this:

makefile
Copy code
Indices:    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Heights:    1 8 6 2 5 4 8 3 7
Each index of the array represents the x-coordinate, and the value at that index represents the height of a vertical line at that position.

Container Formation
To form a container, you choose any two lines (let's say at indices i and j, where i < j). These lines, together with the x-axis, create a container. The amount of water the container can hold depends on two factors:

Height of the Container: Determined by the shorter of the two lines (min(height[i], height[j])).
Width of the Container: The distance between the two lines (j - i).
Calculation of Water Area
The area of water that the container can hold is given by:
Area
=
Height
×
Width
Area=Height×Width

Area=min(height[i],height[j])×(j−i)

Example Breakdown
Example 1: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
The two lines that form the container with the maximum water are at indices 1 and 8 (heights 8 and 7 respectively).
Height of the container: min(8, 7) = 7
Width of the container: 8 - 1 = 7
Maximum water area: 7 * 7 = 49
