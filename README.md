# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions and my approaches to various LeetCode problems. Each solution is organized into folders, with each problem having its own `README.md` file detailing the approach, solution, and examples used for that particular problem.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem has a dedicated folder named after the problem, containing:
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem, approach, and solution details.
  - Solution files: Code files implementing the solution in Python

## Purpose

The main objective of this repository is to document and organize solutions to LeetCode problems, improving problem-solving skills and serving as a reference for coding interview preparation. Solutions are designed to be efficient and written with readability and clarity in mind.
